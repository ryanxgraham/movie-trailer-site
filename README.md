# Movie Trailer Website
Source code for a Movie Trailer website for my Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree Program at Udacity

This project creates a website with a list of some of my favorite movies along with their respective posters. When a user clicks on the posters, a youtube trailer of that movie plays.

This project is forked from Udacity's ud036_StarterCode. I implemented functionality in Python that creates a series of "Movie" classes, uses them in creating an HTML website, and subsequently launches the aforementioned HTML site.


### Prerequesites
Ensure that Python 3+ and git are installed:
```
python --version
git --version
```


### Installing

From the Terminal, clone this repo onto your computer with:

```
git clone https://github.com/ryanxgraham/movie-trailer-site
```

Move into the new directory:

```
cd movie-trailer-site/
```

Run the entertainment_center.py to generate the movie trailer website:

```
python3 entertainment_center.py
```

This will create an HMTL file called "fresh_tomatoes.html" and launch a browser displaying this page.
